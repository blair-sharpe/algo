# Algorithm Challanges

Can't reverse a linked list? Embarrassing. Challenge yourself! This is a place to be better at coding challanges. Chapters will be added every week.

## Setup

1.  fork the repo or ask to be a collaborator 
2.  pick a problem from the `/questions` folder
3.  create a username folder that starts with the first letter of your first name and followed by your full lastname under `/solutions` folder
4.  create a folder with the name of the chapter you are working on under your folder name (ex. arrays)
5.  under that folder create a file for the solution with the corresponding chosen problem in the file name (ex. arrays_1.1.js)
6.  complete steps 2 to 3 under the folder `tests` and name your file the same as your problem file but with .test.js extension (arrays_1.1.test.js)
7.  run tests **and** coverage 
8.  make a pull request with a **label**

## Commands

```bash

# tests all solutions
npm run test:all

# tests the problem you are working on
npm run test:problem --user=yourusername --file=yourfilename.test.js

# runs test coverage summary
npm run test:coverage:summary

# runs test coverage with file names
npm run test:coverage

```
