# Algorithm Challanges

Challange yourself! This is a place to be better at coding challanges.

## Setup

1. pick a problem from the `/questions` folder
2. create a folder that starts with the first letter of your first name and followed by your full lastname under `/solutions` folder
3. create a folder with the name of the chapter you are working on under your folder name (ex. arrays)
4. under that folder create a file for the solution with the corresponding chosen problem in the file name (ex. arrays_1.1.js)
5. complete steps 2 to 3 under the folder `tests` and name your file the same as your problem file but with .test.js extension (arrays_1.1.test.js)
6. setup config.sh with 
    a) `USERNAME` same as folder name in step 2
    b) `FILE` set to the file name set in step 4 
    c) `TEST_FILE` same as file name set in step 5
8. run `bash build.sh`
