# Algorithm Challanges

Challange yourself! This is a place to be better at coding challanges.

## setup
1. pick a problem from the /problems folder
2. create a folder that starts with the first letter of your first name and followed by your full lastname under /solutions
3. create a folder for the type of problem you are working on under your folder name (ex. arrays)
4. create a file for your solution with the corresponding problem in the file name (ex. arrays_1.1.js)
5. complete steps 2 to 3 under the folder tests and name your file the same as your problem file but with .test.js extension
6. setup config.sh
7. run `bash build.sh`
