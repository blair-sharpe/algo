# Arrays

[Helpful Tips](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/array/)

## Problem Set

1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
can not use additional data structures?

1.2 Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as
five characters, including the null character.)

1.3 Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string
without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine.
An extra copy of the array is not.

1.4 Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.

1.5 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.

1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

1.7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column is set to 0.

1.8 Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of
another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using
only one call to isSubstring (i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).
