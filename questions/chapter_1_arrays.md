# Arrays

[Helpful Tips](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/array/)

## Problem Set

1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith "J 13
Output: "Mr%20J ohn%20Smith"

1.4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat". "atco cta". etc.)

1.5 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.
EXAMPLE
pale, pIe -> true
pales. pale -> true
pale. bale -> true
pale. bake -> false

1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. (an you do this in place?

1.8 Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to O.

1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubst ring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

1.10  Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 
You can return the answer in any order.

1.12 Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

1.13 There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Prior to being passed to your function, nums
is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

1.14 You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. 
You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

1.15 Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

1.16 Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
